This is a basic customer registration program, it has functions such as add, modify and delete data.

The Interfaces folder has 6 files which are: clients, delete, login, modify, new and register.

Client: in this we show the visualization of the table, as well as the buttons new, modify, delete and close session.
Delete: in this one we will be able to delete a record, only with entering a user (registered).
Login: in this one we will enter to the system (Client) and contains buttons to register and to log in.
Modify: in this one we will be able to modify data of some registered user, we will have a button "Search" which we will add the user to 
we will add the user to modify and it will bring you all the data of that user.
New: in this one we will be able to register a new user.
Register: in this one, is where we will register to enter to the system (Client).


The Connection folder has 3 files which are: DBCuser, DBconnection, DBregistration.

DBCusuario: here we find the method to validate the users and the email, so that there are no duplicates and the email is correct
and the method to confirm password.
DBconnection: here is where the connection is made to call the database to our program.
DBregistry: here we have Strings stored to use them in the registry.


Extras:

*If we leave the empty fields in the registry we get an alert.
*If the passwords do not coincide in the registry an alert comes out.
*If we try to initiate session without data an alert comes out.
*Once we add, modify or delete a user, this will be automatically reflected in the main screen.
